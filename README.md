This Github repository serves as a storage for the data-analysis of the FWO project G080221N: Dealing with the heat and a changed prey composition: urban
adaptation in the garden spider

The data are structured according to the different work packages

WP 1: Quantifying prey availability, quantity and consumption along replicated urban gradients.
WP 2: Quantifying the link between colouration and urbanisation and its function in thermoregulation
WP 3: Testing the reciprocal interactions between diet and body colouration.
WP 4: Testing the adaptive value of urban phenotypic changes
